      "Report: Multiple findings are present including bilateral perihilar opacities, possible effusions indicated by blunting of the costophrenic angles, and potential atelectasis or consolidation in the region of the minor fissure. Atherosclerotic and mitral annular calcifications are noted, alongside an enlarged cardiac silhouette. There are also multiple compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine.   Additional findings include moderate enlargement of the heart, central vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema and right lower and middle lobe densities which may indicate consolidations. No pneumothorax is seen.  The presence of multifocal regions of consolidation are compatible with metastatic lesions in the lungs. However, no definitive acute cardiopulmonary process is identified.  Chronic pulmonary fibrotic changes are noted extensively, especially in the peripheral basal regions. Cardiomegaly is moderate and stable. There is no identified pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Increasing bibasilar opacities may suggest atelectasis. The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions are probable. Interstitial thickening in the lingula is suggested by a shaggy heart border. Interstitial lung markings consistent with chronic interstitial lung disease were observed throughout the lung, potentially indicating volume loss. Bilateral shoulder injuries are noted including a dislocated left glenohumeral joint and a fractured right proximal humerus.\n",

These findings could reflect volume loss in the right middle and lower lobes with pleural effusion. However, much of this appearance could be a manifestation of developing pneumonia. Little change in the opacification is at the left base.

Blunting of posterior costophrenic angles suggestive of effusions. Linear opacity in the region of the minor fissure suggests fluid within the fissure versus potential adjacent atelectasis or other cause of consolidation. The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged likely exaggerated by poor inspiratory effort. Dense mitral annular calcifications are noted as well as atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta which is tortuous.

Increasing pleural effusion on the left. Continued enlargement the cardiac silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. FINAL REPORT EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION: ___ year old man with COPD // int change int change IMPRESSION: In comparison with the study of ___, there is increased opacification in the lower ___ of the right hemithorax in this patient with severe chronic pulmonary disease and biapical scarring. These findings could reflect volume loss in the right middle and lower lobes with pleural effusion. However, much of this appearance could be a manifestation of developing pneumonia. Little change in the opacification is at the left base. FINAL REPORT INDICATION: ___ year old man with hypoxemia, ? etiology // ___ year old man with hypoxemia, ? etiology COMPARISON: Radiographs from ___. IMPRESSION: There has been worsening of the areas of consolidation and interstitial prominence throughout both lung fields. There are more confluent areas of consolidation in the perihilar regions and in the left base. No pneumothoraces are identified. Findings may relate to multifocal pneumonia as previously suspected; however superimposed pulmonary edema could also be present. FINAL REPORT EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION: ___ year old man s/p ct pull // eval for ptx TECHNIQUE: Single frontal view of the chest COMPARISON: ___ IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion has increased. Right pleural effusion and right lower lobe and right middle lobe consolidations have increased. There are low lung volumes. Cardiomegaly cannot be assessed. There is no evident pneumothorax. FINAL REPORT EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION: ___ year old man with PAH, refract hypoxemia // Eval for interval change Eval for interval change IMPRESSION: Heart size and mediastinum are stable. Right mid lung consolidation appears to be an more conspicuous concerning for infectious process. Interstitial changes are extensive, similar to previous examination. Small amount of bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present. There is no pneumothorax. Oxygen mask and tubing artifact (portable radiograph) described by Patchy air space opacities are noted in the bilateral mid to lower zones and left retrocardiac region which may be suggestive of worsening infective changes. A small left pleural effusion is noted with adjacent atelectasis. No gross pneumothorax is detected. No subdiaphragmatic free gas is seen. Aortic calcifications are noted. Degenerative changes are noted of the imaged spine on a background of diffuse osteopenia. An old right 9th rib fracture is also seen.

      "Report: Large right pleural effusion post thoracentesis, with an increasing left pleural effusion. Moderate enlargement of cardiac silhouette with mild to moderate pulmonary vascular congestion. Increased opacification in lower right hemithorax potentially indicating volume loss with right middle and lower lobe pleural effusion or developing pneumonia. Worsening areas of consolidation and interstitial prominence in both lung fields, with potentially multifocal pneumonia or superimposed pulmonary edema. Significant increase in size of left pleural effusion, right pleural effusion and right lower lobe and middle lobe consolidation. No evident pneumothorax. Stable heart size and mediastinum with possible enhanced right mid lung consolidation suggestive of an infectious process. Extensive interstitial changes with likely small bilateral pleural effusions. Patchy air space opacities in bilateral mid to lower zones and left retrocardiac region suggestive of worsening infectious changes. Small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis. No gross pneumothorax or subdiaphragmatic free gas. Moderate to large pleural effusion with multiple septations/loculations and underlying consolidation, pointing to a thoracic empyema. Notable large retrocardiac cystic lesion with air/fluid level suggestive of a hiatus hernia.\n",
